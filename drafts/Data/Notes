hg19:

Sequencing read length: PE150

Alignment: In this project, total clean reads per sample were aligned to the human reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)

On average, 99.84% mapped successfully and 95.46% mapped uniquely. The duplicate reads were marked from total mapped reads, resulting in about 1.08% and 117.47-fold mean sequencing depth on the whole genome excluding gap regions. On average per sequencing individual, 99.84% of the whole genome excluding gap regions were covered by at least 1X coverage.

hg38:

Alignment: All clean reads were aligned to the human reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA
V0.7.17) . We did mapping for each lane separately and also add the read group identifier, which
by lane, into the alignment files. Here we used BWA-MEM method. Below are the BWA information
and commands used for the alignments:
Software Version Link
BWA v0.7.17 http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/
Here the 'read_group_tag' need to be provided, e.g.,
'@RG\tID:GroupID\tSM:SampleID\tPL:illumina\tLB:libraryID'.
Then, use samtools to sort the SAM files according to the mapped position and convert them into
BAM format files. The software information and command line parameters are as follows:
