hg19:

Variant Calling: Germline mutation calling is based on the comparison result Bam file, including the detection and
annotation of SNP, InDel, SV and CNV (the latter two are limited to whole-genome sequencing).

Quality Assurance: To ensure accurate variant calling, we followed recommended
Best Practices for variant analysis with the Genome Analysis Toolkit(GATK). Base quality score
recalibration and duplicate reads marked were performed using GATK . The sequencing depth and
coverage for each individual were calculated based on the alignments.
In addition, the strict data analysis quality control system(QC) in the whole pipeline was built to
guarantee qualified sequencing data.

1. DNA fragmentation
2. Size selection
3. End repair and "A" tailing
4. Adapter ligation
5. Product size selection
6. PCR reaction
7. Library QC
8. Sequencing
Sequencing-derived raw image files were processed by DNBSEQ basecalling Software for base-calling
with default parameters and the sequence data of each individual was generated as paired-end
reads, which was defined as "raw data" and stored in FASTQ format.


hg38:

Variant Calling: Use GATK HaplotypeCaller tool to simultaneously detect SNPs and InDels . The principle is to do
partial denovo assembly of haplotypes in areas with variant signals. The original mutation set is
stored in VCF format, which includes all potential mutation sites. The software information and
command line parameters are as follows:
