README - High-fidelity long read dataset of HG002, Ashkenazim Son
Last Updated:  August 31, 2018 

BACKGROUND
This README file contains information for the SMRT Sequencing data from a 
HG002/NA24385/huAA53E0, Ashkenazim Son sample using Binding/Sequencing chemistry 
3.0 and SMRT Link 6.0. One shotgun library was prepared from a NIST reference material
DNA sample(RM 8392,https://shop.nist.gov/ccrz__ProductDetails?sku=8391&cclcl=en_US). 
selection was performed,targeting a narrow size band ~10kb using the sageELF DNA size-selection system 
from SAGE Science. Circular consenus sequences were calculated using default 
parameters and a predicted read accuracy filter of Q20 (99%) using SMRT Link 
6.0. The library was sequenced to approximately 30-fold coverage.
