METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

[Provide information on how the data was generated with enough information and
access to input files that someone could reproduce.  If bfx tools were used
provide links to publications, links to tools themselves should be included in
"Software".  If scripts or python notebooks were used to generate files include
names of scripts and where scripts can be accessed. Input files will be
addressed under "Dependencies". This section can be organized as it makes sense
for the data being presented.]

**Dependencies** 
- [Dependency file 1](insert_url) downloaded [yyyymmdd] 
- [Dependency file 2](insert_url) downloaded [yyyymmdd]

**Software**
- [Tool 1](url) [insert version]
- [Tool 2](url) [insert version]

**Post Processing**\
[Use this section, as appropriate, to describe any post
processing that might have been applied to groups of files to make them
consistent. Like methods, provide script and python notebook information and if
needed add "Dependencies" and "Software" sections.]

**Quality Assurance**\
[Use this section, as appropriate, to provide information
on how the data presented by this README was vetted for accuracy and/or
integrity.  If scripts or notebooks were used provide that information.]

**File Structure**\
[Use this section, as appropriate to, describe file
structure that can be variable, e.g bedfile fields. Provide links to file format
specifications as appropriate.]

**File Naming Convention**\
[If a standard format for naming files was used
provide information of variable fields to aid in understanding of what file
includes by looking at the filename e.g.
GRCh38_SimpleRepeat_[RepeatUnit]_[TotalRepeatLength]_slopadded.bed.gz]
